## AP Program Analysis

This repository features an analysis into the AP Program. The Advanced Placement (AP) system to accelerate their learning in preparation for post-secondary education by completing pre-requisite courses early on for credits and even to impact admission choices. But the system
has also known an under-representation of students in certain ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds as well as much stronger emphasis on STEM programs than Arts programs. In this study, using data obtained from College Board, we can explore historical data of the AP Program through the decade of 2009-2019, and explain the differences in student demographic, scores and participation among AP subjects.
